## Overview

CableTrack PRO is the premier tool to enable electricians to quickly and easily create cable schedules for their projects. It allows the tracking of the cable meta-data, pull-ins, terminations, and tests. All of this is designed to allow the
electricians to quickly and easily create the Building Information Management (BIM) reports and exports for their projects.

## Milestones

CableTrack PRO development is managed via Milestone projects and the issues they contain.

### [M1](https://github.com/orgs/ingeniouspartners/projects/1)

In Milestone 1, we concentrated on laying out foundational functionality, primarily the components that will be used to create the pages.

### [M2](https://github.com/orgs/ingeniouspartners/projects/2)

In Milestone 2, we will be putting together the pages utilizing the components created during M1. This should lead to a second round of page development where we refactor code for re-usability.

### [M3](https://github.com/orgs/ingeniouspartners/projects/3)

In Milestone 3, we instrumented the code with tests and added documentation.

## Developer Guide

### Downloading

First, [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).

Second, go to [CableTrack PRO Repository](https://github.com/ingeniouspartners/cabletrack.pro), and click the "Code" button. Select the "Download ZIP" option at the bottom of the menu.

### Installing

Third, go to your newly created repository, and click the "Clone or download" button to download your new GitHub repo to your local file system.  Using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is a great choice if you use MacOS or Windows.

Fourth, cd into the app/ directory of your local copy of the repo, and install third party libraries with:

```
$ meteor npm install
```

## Running the system

Once the libraries are installed, you can run the application by invoking the "start" script in the [package.json file](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react/blob/master/app/package.json):

```
$ meteor npm run start
```

The first time you run the app, it will create some default users and data. Here is the output:

```
 meteor npm run start 

> meteor-application-template-react@ start /Users/carletonmoore/GitHub/ICS314/meteor-application-template-react/app
> meteor --no-release-check --exclude-archs web.browser.legacy,web.cordova --settings ../config/settings.development.json

```

Periodically, you might see `Error starting Mongo (2 tries left): Cannot run replSetReconfig because the node is currently updating its configuration` after the `=> Started HMR server.`. It doesn't seem to be a problem since the MongoDB does start.

### Viewing the running app

If all goes well, the template application will appear at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  You can login using the credentials in [settings.development.json](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react/blob/main/config/settings.development.json), or else register a new account.
