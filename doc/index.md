# CableTrack PRO

## Landing Page

To a user that is not signed in, this page delivers a CableTrack PRO branded look & feel, with a call to action to sign up or sign in. The only menu item available is the "Login" drop down with "Sign In" and "Sign Up" options.

Once the user signs in, the page will display their company logo and a list of all the active projects to which the user has access. The login menu has been replaced with a user menu, which includes the user's name, with a "Profile" and "Sign Out"
option.

The user can click on the title of a project or the ??? icon link to view that project details. Depending on their permissions, there maybe a pencil icon link on the row to allow editing of the project details. Also a new project can be created by
clicking the ??? icon link at the top of the list if the user has permissions to create projects.

## ViewCompany Page

This pages displays the company information, including the company logo, name, address, phone number, and email address. Depending on the user's permissions, there may be a pencil icon link to allow editing of the company details. If the user is a
GlobalAdmin, there will be a ??? icon link to allow the user to add a new company.

## EditCompany

This page does double-duty as the Add and Edit page, since they are so similar. The page displays a form with the company details, including the company logo, name, address, phone number, and email address. If the Company ID is passed to the form, it
reads the Company details from the database and populates the form. If the Company ID is not passed, the form is blank and ready for a new company to be added. On submit, the database is updated if in edit mode, otherwise the new record is inserted
